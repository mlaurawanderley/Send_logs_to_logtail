**New to Logtail?** [Here's a low-down on logging in JavaScript.](https://github.com/logtail/logtail-js)

## `@logtail/winston`

This NPM library is for creating a [Winston 3.x](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)-compatible transport that transmits logs to Logtail.com via the `@logtail/node` logger.

Here's how to get started:

## Installation

Install the Node.js Logtail logger and the Winston transport via NPM:

```
npm i @logtail/node @logtail/winston
```

## Importing

In ES6/Typescript, import both the `Logtail` logger class and the Logtail Winston transport class:

```typescript
import { Logtail } from "@logtail/node";
import { LogtailTransport } from "@logtail/winston";
```

For CommonJS, require the packages instead:

```js
const { Logtail } = require("@logtail/node");
const { LogtailTransport } = require("@logtail/winston");
```

## Creating a client/transport

You can [create a client](https://github.com/logtail/logtail-js/tree/master/packages/node#creating-a-client) the usual way for `@logtail/node`, and then pass it into a new instance of `LogtailTransport`:

```typescript
// Assuming you've imported the Logtail packages above,
// also import Winston...
import winston from "winston";

// Create a Logtail client
const logtail = new Logtail("logtail-source-token");

// Create a Winston logger - passing in the Logtail transport
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [new LogtailTransport(logtail)],
});

// Log as normal in Winston - your logs will sync with Logtail.com!
logger.log({
  level: "info", // <-- will use Logtail's `info` log level,
  message: "Some message", // <-- will also be passed to Logtail
});
```

## Dealing with TypeScript issues

You may encounter TypeScript errors when including the transformer, which can be fixed by modifying the TypeScript config.


For a `'TransportStream'` error:
```
Argument of type 'LogtailTransport' is not assignable to parameter of type 'TransportStream'.
  Type 'LogtailTransport' is missing the following properties from type 'TransportStream': writable, writableEnded, writableFinished, writableHighWaterMark, and 29 more.
```

Modify `tsconfig.json` with:
```
  "moduleResolution": "node",
  "esModuleInterop": true
```
